        <h2>üìú Learning Journey</h2>
        <p>
          I am a driven Full-Stack software professional with a core focus on Business and Data Analysis, propelled by proficiency in C# and a solid foundation in Microsoft ASP.Net MVC. My commitment to delivering high-quality solutions tailored to diverse business needs reflects my passion for innovative technology-driven solutions. My expertise spans a range of technologies, including JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, and more, which fuels my dedication to crafting cutting-edge applications that align with evolving user demands. I have earned a reputation for my unwavering dedication, focus, and my ability to excel within fast-paced environments.
        </p>

        <p>
          My transformative journey at SAIT shaped me into a proficient Full-Stack developer, building foundational skills in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, and advancing to expertise in React, Microsoft ASP.Core, Microsoft Framework, and Microsoft ASP.Net MVC. Immersed in the Microsoft ecosystem, I honed skills to bridge user interfaces with back-end functionalities and reinforce my Microsoft SQL expertise for seamless database integration. This transformative experience not only expanded my technical prowess but ignited my passion for innovative digital solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          My professional journey in software development began with a Bachelor of Commerce degree, majoring in Management Information Systems (MIS) with a minor in Accounting, from the University of Alberta. This educational background underscores my deep comprehension of the intricate interplay between technology and business operations. During my time at UofA, I was introduced to pivotal concepts such as Microsoft SQL and relational databases, as well as methodologies like Agile Development, Kanban, and Object-Oriented Design (UML). This foundation laid the groundwork for my subsequent career development.  
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout my career, I adeptly applied principles from Kanban and Agile projects, honing expertise in front-end and back-end programming, application development, automated testing, and version control. My portfolio demonstrates this growth through diverse projects integrating React, Three.js for 3D websites, and React Native apps with Node.js backend development using Express.js for API access. These integrations seamlessly connect with databases in technologies like Postgres, SQLite, and MongoDB. My unwavering commitment to successful project delivery remains a constant in my professional journey.

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>

        <p>
          My most comprehensive project to date is the Twitter clone project available on my GitHub repository. This React-Native application functions seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms, developed using Expo. The backend is implemented in Node.js and employs Express.js for seamless API integration. Initially, the backend was constructed using SQLite, and in subsequent iterations, it was transitioned to Postgresql, and ultimately hosted on AWS for enhanced performance and accessibility.
        </p>
